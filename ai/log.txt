We always represent and compute language model probabilities in log format
as log probabilities. Since probabilities are (by definition) less than or equal to 1, log
probabilities
the more probabilities we multiply together, the smaller the product becomes. Multiplying
enough N-grams together would result in numerical underflow. By using
log probabilities instead of raw probabilities, we get numbers that are not as small.


概率在[0,1],多个小概率相乘，很容易数值溢出，这时候需要用log函数。
