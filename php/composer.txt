PSR-4#

Under the psr-4 key you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root. When autoloading a class like Foo\\Bar\\Baz a namespace prefix Foo\\ pointing to a directory src/ means that the autoloader will look for a file named src/Bar/Baz.php and include it if present. Note that as opposed to the older PSR-0 style, the prefix (Foo\\) is not present in the file path.

Namespace prefixes must end in \\ to avoid conflicts between similar prefixes. For example Foo would match classes in the FooBar namespace so the trailing backslashes solve the problem: Foo\\ and FooBar\\ are distinct.

The PSR-4 references are all combined, during install/update, into a single key => value array which may be found in the generated file vendor/composer/autoload_psr4.php.

Example:

{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Monolog\\": "src/",
            "Vendor\\Namespace\\": ""
        }
    }
}
If you need to search for a same prefix in multiple directories, you can specify them as an array as such:

{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "Monolog\\": ["src/", "lib/"] }
    }
}
If you want to have a fallback directory where any namespace will be looked for, you can use an empty prefix like:

{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": { "": "src/" }
    }
}


SR-4的：

vendor/
  vendor_name/
    package_name/
      src/
        ClassName.php	   # Vendor_Name\Package_Name\ClassName
      tests/
        ClassNameTest.php   # Vendor_Name\Package_Name\ClassNameTest
