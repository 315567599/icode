The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__variable, described later.
在文件夹中包含一个__init__.py，Python就会把文件夹当作一个package，里面的py文件就能够在外面被import了。
